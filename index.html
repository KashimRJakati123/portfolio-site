        <h1>KASHIM JAKATI</h1>
        <h3>Software Engineer</h3>

        <p>
          Hi, I’m Kashim. I’m passionate about building scalable software
          solutions and always eager to learn new technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          With experience in <strong>Java, Spring Boot, and React.js</strong>, I
          enjoy developing clean, efficient, and maintainable applications that
          solve real-world problems. My focus is on writing code that is not
          only functional but also optimized for performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond coding, I enjoy learning about system design, exploring best
          practices in software architecture, and collaborating with teams to
          deliver high-quality solutions. I strongly believe in continuous
          learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
